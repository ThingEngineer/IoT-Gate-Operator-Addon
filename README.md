# IoT Gate Operator Addon
IoT Gate Operator Addon with web app based on the electric imp

I have a client who has a gated area where many people needed to come and go. They did not want to use a keypad outside of the gate and only had a limited number of keyfob transmitters. Finding an affordable source for additional keyfobs was difficult. I thought it would be an excellent opportunity to upgrade this LiftMaster gate operator with an external IoT add on. This solved the group access problem and opened up additional functionality as well. It is now possible to latch the gate open for extended periods and see the status of the gate (open, closed, etc).

This is a fully functioning solution with all code and designs listed here.
